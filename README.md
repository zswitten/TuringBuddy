Automatic CAPTCHA-like Check-ins

This is an app designed for caretakers to help their friends or family who suffer temporary but unpredictable bouts of disorientation/amnesia.

At selected intervals, it will text the care-ee with some basic questions as form of check-in.

If the care-ee doesn't answer within a certain interval, the carer receives a text notification.

The texting occurs through Twilio.
